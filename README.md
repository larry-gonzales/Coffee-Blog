# Coffee-Blog

A multipage, responsive website for a fictitious Coffee blog.

Technologies:

• HTML
• CSS

The purpose of this project was to create an HTML file that is structured in one way, and then reorganized with CSS. From an accessibility standpoint, the site will read in a logical order of headline, body copy, and then followed by images, dates, etc. This practice also creates a fallback for older browsers that do not support various features, while keeping the content formatted properly in the event a page does not load as intended. Alternatively, the items are stacked (using CSS) to promote the image on top of the headline and text to produce a more traditional visual layout.
